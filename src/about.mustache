  <h2>Our Story</h2>

  <p>
    It begins with Storyscript, our domain-specific language.
    Years back while working on applications for small businesses customers asked for unique, long-running business logic to automate marketing and customer retention, among other business logic. These stories were written down in a format that the client could read and understand the logic behind the application.
    A transparent, syntax-light, language emerged through the common logic patterns that read like a book.
    Storyscript was born and paved the way for a new technique of rapidly prototyping applications.

      At that moment the technologies to create a large-scale platform to run these stories where not ready yet, so the idea remained
      stuck in Steve's mind for some years. 2017 came and now it was time to make it work: Asyncy was quickly prototyped and put in
      development.

      Now we are promoting Asyncy and StoryScript at meetups and conferences and preparing for the beta launch.
