  <h2>Our Story</h2>

  <p>
    It begins with Storyscript, our domain-specific language.
    Years back while working on applications for small businesses customers asked for unique, long-running business logic to automate marketing and customer retention, among other business logic. These stories were written down in a format that the client could read and understand the logic behind the application.
    A transparent, syntax-light, language emerged through the common logic patterns that read like a book.
    Storyscript was born and paved the way for a new technique of rapidly prototyping applications.
